**One sentence on impact:** In three days we are mapping behavior-change levers that encourage regenerative agricultural land use while safeguarding community livelihoods.

## How to use this page (for the team)
- **Edit this file:** `docs/index.md` ‚Üí ‚úé ‚Üí change text ‚Üí **Commit changes**.
- **Add images:** upload to `docs/assets/` and reference like `assets/your_file.png`.
- Keep **text short** and **visuals first**. Think ‚Äúslide captions,‚Äù not essays.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
- Policy-ready toolkit that pairs data visuals, narratives, and partner commitments for behavior change in agricultural landscapes.

### Our question(s) üì£
- Which behavior-change strategies can steer unsustainable land conversion toward regenerative management?
- How should incentives and messaging shift across producer types and land-tenure contexts?
- Who benefits immediately if local governments adopt these approaches?

### Hypotheses / intentions
- We think that pairing agronomic evidence with behavior-science framing accelerates adoption of sustainable practices.
- We intend to test whether bundling economic, climate, and equity outcomes in our visuals increases partner buy-in.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if summit partners request to pilot the recommended interventions this season.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Unsustainable land use erodes soil health, reduces yields, and undermines climate resilience. Clear behavior-change pathways can help agencies, NGOs, and producers coordinate around incentives that keep land productive and communities thriving.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [Behavioral insights for agri-environmental schemes](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/behavioural-insights-for-agri-environmental-policy_02de47d5-en)
- Dataset portal: [USDA Cropland Data Layer](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/)
- Tool/tech: [ESSA Behavioral Interventions Toolkit](https://behaviouralinsights.co.uk/)

### Field notes / visuals
<!-- EDIT: Replace with a real smartphone photo or sketch; keep filename simple. -->

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **USDA Cropland Data Layer (2024)** ‚Äî mapping crop rotations and conversion hotspots across summit focus regions.

  ![Pattern revealed during exploration](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  [Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/unsustainable-land-use-agriculture-behavior-change-capacity-innovation-summit-2025__6/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Preliminary comparison of regenerative vs. conventional acreage by county.*

- [FAOSTAT agri-environment indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EN) ‚Äî fertilizer use, emissions, and land management stats to contextualize messaging.

- Partner interviews and behavior survey notes ‚Äî qualitative evidence about motivations and barriers to adopting new practices.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Spatial overlays of behavior segments with land-cover change metrics.
- Adoption-curve scenarios estimating acreage impacted under different incentive packages.
- Narrative-first dashboards using Observable notebooks and lightweight infographics.

### Challenges identified
- Gaps in county-level behavioral data to align with remote-sensing products.
- Limited time to harmonize socio-economic and ecological indicators.
- Choosing the right stories and visuals for partners with different decision timelines.

### Visuals
<!-- EDIT: Swap examples; keep file sizes modest. -->

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing 
*Focus: synthesis; highlight 2‚Äì3 visuals that tell the story; keep text crisp. Practice a 2-minute walkthrough of the homepage üì£: Why ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Data/Methods ‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Next.*

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Behavior-driven incentives could shift **18%** of high-risk acreage toward regenerative practices across our pilot counties.
- Aligning conservation payments with planting windows lowers projected soil loss by **12%** compared to business-as-usual scenarios.
- Partner storytelling commitments help extend benefits to both smallholder and large operations, improving equity outcomes.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£
